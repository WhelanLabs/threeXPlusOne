# Three X Plus One

## Overview


This program was designed to work on the Colletz Conjecture by finding the smallest number that contains a closed loop sequence.  For this application, a closed loop sequence starts with a minimum number that through the Colletz sequence ends up looping back to the same number without having that sequence hit a lower value.  For example, the number one is a minimum number for the closed loop of {1,4,2,1}.

This application works on an sets of natural numbers.  I refer to these sets by what I call their Tail Squences, and works in binary.  As an example, consider the numbers with a Tail Sequence of "X0101"; this set of numbers would include all natural numbers where the binary representation ends in "0101", which includes {5, 21, 37, 53, ...}.  This set of numbers can be represented as "16X+5", where X is any natural number.
